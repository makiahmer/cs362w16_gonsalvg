My unit tests seem to have been successful in their tests, and I even think I 
discovered a small bug in the isGameOver function. The treasure map isn't coun-
ted as a supply pile, but the game counts it as a qualifying input for one of
the three empty supply piles necessary to have the game end. In any case, the
coverages for the unit tests seemed fairly small, but larger than I expected.
Most of them were around 20% coverage, which doesn't mean the tests aren't necesarily
comprehensive but rather more specific. The same goes for the card tests.
