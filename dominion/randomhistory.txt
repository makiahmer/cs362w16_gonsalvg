File for Assignment 3

Because I didn't have much experience writing a random test, I tried not to stray
too far from the example tests. I spent a lot of time wondering why my test was segfaulting
only to realize that I was attempting to run my code on my bugged-riddled version of
dominion.c. I ran the tests and got the outputs after running the tests on the master copy
of the game.

The makefile mostly follows the skeleton file provided for us.
